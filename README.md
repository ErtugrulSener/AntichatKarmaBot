# AntichatKarmaBot
A bot written in python that does mine some karma points for the app "Antichat".

# Features
- Anti-Ban: Implicates normal conversations with waiting times between them.
- Fake-Chats: Creates fake chats to hide the bot character in any message.
- Session-Checker: If a session is interrupted, it will retry twice instead of closing the connection directly.
- Auto-Gift: Gifts a specific person any time 1000 karma is reached, so that the bots automatically push one account.
- Proxy-Checker: If a proxy needs too long (4 seconds indeed) to respond it will delete this proxy out of the proxylist for more stability.

# Before using the bot
- Set the group id's or feel free to use my internal groups:
```python
self.groups = ["vDqRPhZLNi", "7eyQpyYtoB", "fecwhZEVXV"]
```
- Set the id of the lucky receiver, who will get all the karma generated by the bots:
```python
self.karma_receiver_id = "qLQqSw9uHJ"
```
